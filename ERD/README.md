# Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

This directory contains the Entity-Relationship Diagram for the AirBnB database and its related documentation.

## Files in this Directory

- `requirements.md`: Detailed specifications of all entities, attributes, relationships, constraints, and indexing for the database.
- `ERD.png`: Visual representation of the database schema showing all entities and their relationships.

## ERD Explanation

The ERD visually represents the database schema with:

1. **Entities**: Represented as boxes (User, Property, Booking, Payment, Review, Message)
2. **Attributes**: Listed within each entity box
3. **Relationships**: Shown as lines connecting related entities
4. **Cardinality**: Indicated at the ends of relationship lines showing one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationships

## Instructions for Updating the ERD

If you need to update the ERD:

1. Use a tool like Draw.io, Lucidchart, or ERDPlus
2. Export the diagram as a PNG file
3. Replace the existing ERD.png in this directory
4. Update requirements.md if there are corresponding changes to the database specification
